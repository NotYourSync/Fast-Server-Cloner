pip install aiohttp
in termux --> pkg update
                    pkg upgrade
                    pkg install python
                    
Instructions:
Replace:

"your_user_token" with your user token (not bot token).

Replace ENTER_SOURCE_SERVER_ID_HERE with the source guild ID (the server ID you want to copy from).

Replace ENTER_TARGET_SERVER_ID_HERE with the target guild ID (the server you want to copy to).

You should find these IDs by enabling Developer Mode in Discord and right-clicking on the server to copy its ID.
